The --no-cache-dir flag is used when running a command with pip, 
the package installer for Python. When pip is used to install packages,
it stores a copy of the package in a cache directory on the local machine 
to speed up future installs. 
The --no-cache-dir flag tells pip not to use the cache and instead to download 
the package fresh from the internet.
In the context of Docker, using --no-cache-dir is important because it ensures 
that the packages are installed directly from the internet, rather than using a
cached copy that may be out of date or have been altered. This is particularly
important when building Docker images, because it ensures that the image always 
contains the latest versions of the packages and that it is not affected by any 
changes to the local cache.

It is worth noting that this option is not exclusive for pip and docker, but any 
tool or scenario where you want to ensure that a package that is being installed 
is the latest version and not coming from a cache.
